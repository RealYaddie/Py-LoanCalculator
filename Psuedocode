**To-do:
	- Maybe change the input message so the user can choose to enter loan duration in years or months
	- Convert interestRate into the interestRate per month to use it in the formula
	- Still need to figure out how to do the tables
#Declaring and initializing variables
monthly_payment = 0.0	#Output from the program
loan_amount = 0.0		#User enters
interestRate = 0.0		#User enters
numberOfPayments = 0	#What we need to caluclate
loan_duration = 0.0	#User enters
loanAmtRepaid = 0.0 		#Output from the program
cmp_interest = 0.0		#Output from the program

#Get loan  information from the user
loan_amount = float(input('Enter the amount being loaned'))
interestRate = float(input('Enter the interest rate amount'))
loan_duration = int(input('Enter the number of years to repay the loan'))

#Calculation sections
monthly_payment = (loan_amount * interestRate(1 + interestRate)**loan_duration)/((1 + interestRate)**loan_duration - 1)	# Monthly Payment formula
loanAmtRepaid = monthly_payment * loan_duration	#Total amount paid back
